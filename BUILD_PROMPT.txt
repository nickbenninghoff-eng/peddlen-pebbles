Read CLAUDE.md carefully. Build the entire frontend for Peddle'n Pebbles following every specification in that file. Start with the shared layout (Header, Footer), then build all 7 pages (Home, Shop, Product Detail, About, Contact, Blog, Blog Post), create the mock data files, and implement the cart drawer. Use the frontend-design skill for exceptional visual quality. The theme is cozy hobbit aesthetic - earthy greens, warm ambers, rounded shapes, fantasy fonts. Make it BEAUTIFUL. The hero image is already at public/hero.png. When completely finished, run this command: openclaw gateway wake --text "Done: Built all PeddlenPebbles frontend pages" --mode now
