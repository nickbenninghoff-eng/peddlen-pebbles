    title: 'How to Cleanse Your Crystals: A Beginner\'s Guide',
    excerpt: 'Your crystals work hard for you — here\'s how to return the favor. Learn the most popular methods for cleansing and recharging your stones.',
    content: `Your crystals absorb energy from their environment and from you. Over time, they can become energetically "full" and need to be cleansed to restore their natural vibrations.\n\n## Moonlight Bath\nPlace your crystals outside or on a windowsill during a full moon. The gentle lunar energy cleanses and recharges most stones. This is one of the safest methods for all crystal types.\n\n## Running Water\nHold your crystal under cool running water for 1-2 minutes while setting the intention to wash away negativity. **Note:** Some crystals like selenite, halite, and malachite are water-soluble — avoid this method for soft stones.\n\n## Smoke Cleansing\nPass your crystals through the smoke of sage, palo santo, or incense. This ancient practice is gentle and works for all crystal types.\n\n## Selenite Charging\nPlace your crystals on or near a selenite plate or wand overnight. Selenite is self-cleansing and can recharge other stones.\n\n## Sound Cleansing\nUse a singing bowl, tuning fork, or even a bell near your crystals. Sound vibrations can break up stagnant energy.\n\n## How Often?\nCleanse your crystals whenever they feel "heavy" or after intense use. A good rule of thumb is once a month, or after any particularly emotional experience.`,

Cleanse all your crystals first\n2. Find a quiet, undisturbed space\n3. Set your intention clearly in your mind\n4. Place your center stone first\n5. Work outward, placing supporting stones in a symmetric pattern\n6.

Some people keep grids active for days, others for weeks. Trust your intuition — you'll know when the work is complete.`,
